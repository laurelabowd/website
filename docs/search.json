      "contents": "\r\nI graduated from the University of Virginia in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in environmental science and a Bachelor of Arts in leadership and public policy. After graduation, I spent a few years working for the Chesapeake Bay Program before returning to school for my master’s degree in environmental science and management.\r\nI am driven by the intersection of science and policy and am excited to be learning so much while at the Bren School.\r\nMy favorite bird, the osprey, fishing during my last visit to the Outer Banks.RESUME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
