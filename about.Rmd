```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in environmental science and a Bachelor of Arts in leadership and public policy. After graduation, I spent a few years working for the Chesapeake Bay Program before returning to school for my master's degree in environmental science and management. 

I am driven by the intersection of science and policy and am excited to be learning so much while at the Bren School.
